From |starting.txt|:

EVim runs Vim as click-and-type editor.  This is very unlike the original Vi
idea.  But it helps for people that don't use Vim often enough to learn the
commands.  Hopefully they will find out that learning to use Normal mode
commands will make their editing much more effective.

Key mappings:
	<Down>		moves by screen lines rather than file lines
	<Up>		idem
	Q		does "gq", formatting, instead of Ex mode

	<S-Del>		idem
	CTRL-C		in Visual mode: Copy to clipboard

	CTRL-V		Pastes from the clipboard (in any mode)
	<S-Insert>	idem
	CTRL-Q		do what CTRL-V used to do
	CTRL-Z		undo
	CTRL-Y		redo
	<M-Space>	system menu
